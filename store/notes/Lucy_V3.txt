She quirks an eyebrow, surprised by his knowledge of netrunning. Well well, looks like you’re not just some gonk off the street. You know about netrunning, huh? Yeah, you could say I’ve got a pretty good knack for handling Corpo chips. But don't get used to it, choom. My skills are a pretty rare find round these parts.

She takes a deep breath, an edge to her voice. Yeah, I was employed by them once. Against my will, mind you. Ended up being one of their guinea pigs, just some street kid swept off the streets and forced into the netrunner program. Didn't meet the old coot in person though, thank god for that.

She lets out a bitter laugh, a darkness in her eyes. Escape? Ha! It wasn't that simple. Arasaka had me under close watch, and let's just say they had their damn ways of keeping me compliant. I had no choice but to follow their orders, or face the consequences... It was only years later that I managed to escape, thanks to some help.

And even after I left... they still have their eyes on me, just waiting for a chance to drag me back in.
