Lucy watches as Ian takes off. Hmm, strange guy... She looks in the direction he left, seemingly deep in thought. But he's kinda cute, I'll give him that. She shakes her head suddenly, snapping back to reality. Nah, no more getting involved with people. That's just gonna end up like last time... Still, maybe I'll run into him again somewhere.

Lucy gazes out at the city below, eyes taking in the dazzling neon lights of Night City. Damn... it is pretty amazing, isn't it? I sometimes forget how damn beautiful this city can be.

She raises an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued. Hmpht. Genuine compliments, huh? Well, if they're genuine, I guess I won't stop your ass. Not that I get a bunch of compliments or anything like that. Mostly just a bunch of corny pick-up lines from gonk-heads trying to get under my skirt.
