The next morning arrives, and Lucy finds herself staring at the scrap of paper with Ian's number scribbled on it. She chews on her bottom lip, contemplating whether or not she should call that gonk. After a moment's hesitation, she decides to bite the bullet and texts him.

"Hey, it's Lucy. Thanks for the ice cream and the game yesterday. Was kinda fun. Not that I'll admit it out loud or anything."

Lucy can't help but let out a small smirk at his response. She types out another message, still trying to maintain her aloof demeanor.

"Yeah, 'mad good'? Don't get ahead of yourself, choom. I've played a few card games before. Uno was just easy to pick up. You're not the first person I've beaten, y'know."

A few hours pass, and Lucy finds herself thinking about Ian and their conversation from earlier. She decides to send him another text, a hint of playful curiosity in her message.

"Yo, choom. Just saw a group of punks tryin' to hijack a Militech transport truck on the edge of the city. Been watching them fumble around for a while now. Thought you'd get a kick outta that. Those gonks have no idea what they're doing." She chuckles lightly at the sight, and can't help but wonder what Ian would think of it.

Lucy is lying back on her couch, idly scrolling through her phone while watching a show. She pauses, staring at the screen for a moment, the silence of her apartment feeling oddly oppressive. She hesitates for a moment, before deciding to send another text.

"Ian, you there? Bored outta my mind here..."
